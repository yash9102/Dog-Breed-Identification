Dogs are amazing. But when you're in a cafe, have you ever noticed a dog and wondered what breed it is? I have. You wonder how they knew it when someone says, "It's an English Terrier," after which.
In this research, machine learning will be used to assist in the identification of various dog breeds.
We'll use information from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition to do this. It is a collection of more than 10,000 labelled pictures of more than 120 distinct dog breeds.
We're going to utilise TensorFlow 2.x to preprocess our data. The main idea behind this is to turn our data into Tensors, which are numerical arrays that can be executed on GPUs, and then let a machine learning model discover relationships between them.
